## Introduction

In competitive programming contests, one must solve well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified limits or constraints. Typically, the most popular language is C++, followed by Java and Python. Here is my [C++ template](http://ideone.com/qMLEgu) if anyone is interested.

## Getting Started

Start learning any one of the above languages simply by searching up a tutorial [such as this](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cplusplus.com%2Fdoc%2Ftutorial%2F&sa=D) and attempting some of the USACO bronze problems. You should be able to get past USACO Bronze fairly quickly. After that, you can start doing past USACO problems as well as the USACO training pages. (I haven't actually worked through any books.) Once you are familiar with the basics and learn some algorithms, you can start doing some contests. 

Please see the "List of Topics" for details. I tried to keep the lists of topics as short as possible.
