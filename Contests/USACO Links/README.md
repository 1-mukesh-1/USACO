Please let me know if anything is incorrectly categorized or if you have a better categorization system.

## Approximate CF Rating to USACO

Assumes that you have done enough contests such that your rating has stabilized.

  * 1200+: Silver
  * 1400+: Gold
  * 1600+: Platinum
    * Personally I was ~1500 when making platinum (lol), but it's harder nowadays.
  * 1900+: Training Camp - Guernsey
    * 1900 is slightly above the mean rating of 2019 guernseys around April 2019 (whose profiles I could find).
    * However, the converse doesn't hold, meaning that a fair amount of people reach 1900 but never make camp. This is probably due to the fact that 12th graders can't qualify, and there might be a preference for 10th graders over 11th graders (?).
  * Training Camp - Holstein
    * Idk, too much variation.

Please let me know if these are ~~outdated~~ blatantly wrong.
