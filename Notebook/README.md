# README

  * **If you find this organization confusing, please tell me how it could be improved!**
  * This collection is composed of the algorithms I have needed for USACO contests, plus a few more for CodeForces (and now ICPC?). Thanks to kfoldcrossvalidator for some corrections!
  * Many implementations are modified versions of those from [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl).
  * [Notebook Generator](https://github.com/pin3da/notebook-generator) was used to create the PDF.
  * [CPH](https://cses.fi/book.pdf) refers to the competitive programmer's handbook.
    * Section numbers correspond with the [Guide to Competitive Programming](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319725468).
