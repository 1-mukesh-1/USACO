# README

This collection is composed of the algorithms I have needed for USACO contests, plus a few more. [CPH](https://cses.fi/book.pdf) refers to the competitive programmer's handbook.

Note that 1 corresponds to bronze, while 5 corresponds to camp. Topics marked with "Old Gold" have not appeared in recent platinum contests.

I typically do not use implementations marked with "*".
