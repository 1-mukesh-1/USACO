# README

This collection is composed of the algorithms I have needed for USACO contests, plus a few more. [CPH](https://cses.fi/book.pdf) refers to the competitive programmer's handbook.

Note that 1 corresponds to bronze, while 5 corresponds to camp. Topics marked with "Old Gold" have not appeared in recent platinum contests.

# Bronze Topics

  * Sorting
  * Greedy Algorithms

# Silver Topics

    * Types of Graphs (directed, undirected, trees, etc)
    * Flood Fill
    * Breadth-first Search
    * Depth First Search
  * Paradigms
