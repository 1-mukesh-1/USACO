# README

  * This collection is composed of the algorithms I have needed for USACO contests, plus a few more. 
  * [CPH](https://cses.fi/book.pdf) refers to the competitive programmer's handbook.
  * Go [here](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/notebook.pdf) for implementations.
