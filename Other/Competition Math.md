# Competition Math
 
## Pre-Olympiad

If you score <90 on AMC 10:
 * You should make sure that you are familiar with standard algebra concepts. This may not be as easy as you think! 
 * At this stage, doing AMC 8 or MathCounts chapter contests may be helpful.
 * Use Alcumus extensively. Make sure you are familiar with the AoPS Introduction Series!
 * [This](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3h1217349p6066794) is an excellent article pertaining to MathCounts preparation. 
 
If you consistently score 90+ on AMC 10:
 * You should familiarize yourself with everything in the AoPS Introduction Series (Algebra, NT, Combinatorics, Geo). Buy the books if they help (very useful!)
 * Master all of Alcumus.
 * Once you believe that you are familiar with all the material, do past tests! Note that AMC 12's before 2010 are comparable or possibly easier than current AMC 10's. Create a record of your results and review as necessary.
 * Work on improving both speed and accuracy. FTW! may or may not be helpful for this. See [this article](http://artofproblemsolving.com/articles/stupid-mistakes) for eliminating silly mistakes.
 
If you consistently score 120+ on AMC 10:
 * Master all the topics in the intermediate series.
 * Do past AIME's! Follow the time limit, and don't look up solutions unless you are absolutely stuck.
 * Do as many contests as you can (USAMTS, ZIML, etc.)
 * [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B95dMIY7fstOemlzdThlZjFCUnc?usp=sharing) are some AIME resources.
