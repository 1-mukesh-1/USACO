## How do I get better at [insert common topic]?

Just do problems; there are plenty of websites.
  * [Codeforces Problemset](http://codeforces.com/problemset)
  * [HackerRank Dashboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)

## C++11

I recommend that you use C++11 over Java due to various reasons, such as
  * better speed (especially important in codeforces)
  * typically shorter / simpler
  * miscellaneous shortcuts such as #define, typedef, auto
  * good STL
