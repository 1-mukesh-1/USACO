## How do you train??

Well, I just did as many contests as I possibly could, and tried to complete the ones I could not finish during the contest. I'm not sure if there's a better way.

If you feel that you are week in a certain topic, just search up some problems to do with websites such as the following:
  * [Codeforces Problemset](http://codeforces.com/problemset)
  * [HackerRank Dashboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup)
  * [CSAcademy Archive](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/)

## C++11

I recommend that you use C++11 over Java due to various reasons, such as
  * better speed (especially important in codeforces)
  * typically shorter / simpler
  * miscellaneous shortcuts such as #define, typedef, auto
  * good STL
