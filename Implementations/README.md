# README

  * This collection is composed of the algorithms I have needed for USACO contests, plus a few more for CodeForces. Thanks to kfoldcrossvalidator for some corrections!
  * [CPH](https://cses.fi/book.pdf) refers to the competitive programmer's handbook.
  * Experimentation done using [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) and [Notebook Generator](https://github.com/pin3da/notebook-generator).
